# IHH Berhad Malaysia Stock Pitch

My teammates and I embarked on the Certified Financial Associate Research Challenge in this project. We had to pick a stock with a company called IHH Healthcare and decide whether to issue a buy or sell call. Moreover, we had to come up with various theses on the rationale of our decisions. To gather the information we needed, we looked at the Bloomberg terminals provided by our school SUTD and read the news, the analyst reports and the company annual reports to have a better understanding of the management, operations and growth strategies of the company.
